Query for an Array Element that Meets Multiple Criteria

Use $elemMatch operator to specify multiple criteria on the elements of an array such that at least one array element satisfies all the specified criteria.

The following example queries for documents where the dim_cm array contains at least one element that is both greater than ($gt) 22 and less than ($lt) 30:

db.inventory.find( { dim_cm: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 22, $lt: 30 } } } )
