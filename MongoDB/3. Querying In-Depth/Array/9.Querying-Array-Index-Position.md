Query for an Element by the Array Index Position

Using dot notation, you can specify query conditions for an element at a particular index or position of the array. The array uses zero-based indexing.

Note

When querying using dot notation, the field and nested field must be inside quotation marks.

The following example queries for all documents where the second element in the array dim_cm is greater than 25:

db.inventory.find( { "dim_cm.1": { $gt: 25 } } )
