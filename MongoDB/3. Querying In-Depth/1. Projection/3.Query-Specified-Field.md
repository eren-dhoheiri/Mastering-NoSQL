Return the Specified Fields and the _id Field Only

A projection can explicitly include several fields by setting the <field> to 1 in the projection document. The following operation returns all documents that match the query. 

db.article.find( { category: "cryptocurrency" }, { title: 1, author: 1 } )

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

SELECT _id, title, author from article WHERE category = "cryptocurrency"

Suppress _id Field

You can remove the _id field from the results by setting its exclusion <field> to 0 in the projection, as in the following example:

db.inventory.find( { category: "cryptocurrency" }, { title: 1, author: 1, _id: 0 } )

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

SELECT title, author from article WHERE category = "cryptocurrency"
