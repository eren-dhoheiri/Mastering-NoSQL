Return the Specified Fields and the _id Field Only

A projection can explicitly include several fields by setting the <field> to 1 in the projection document. The following operation returns all documents that match the query. In the result set, only the item, status and, by default, the _id fields return in the matching documents.

db.inventory.find( { status: "A" }, { item: 1, status: 1 } )

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

SELECT _id, item, status from inventory WHERE status = "A"

Suppress _id Field

You can remove the _id field from the results by setting its exclusion <field> to 0 in the projection, as in the following example:

db.inventory.find( { status: "A" }, { item: 1, status: 1, _id: 0 } )

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

SELECT item, status from inventory WHERE status = "A"
