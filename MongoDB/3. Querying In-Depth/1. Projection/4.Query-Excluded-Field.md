Return All But the Excluded Fields

Instead of listing the fields to return in the matching document, you can use a projection to exclude specific fields. The following example which returns all fields except for the status and the instock fields in the matching documents:

db.article.find( { category: "cryptocurrency" }, { author: 0, content: 0 } )

Note

With the exception of the _id field, you cannot combine inclusion and exclusion statements in projection documents.
