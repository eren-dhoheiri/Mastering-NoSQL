Specify a Query Condition on a Field Embedded in an Array of Documents

If you do not know the index position of the document nested in the array, concatenate the name of the array field, with a dot (.) and the name of the field in the nested document.

The following example selects all documents where the instock array has at least one embedded document that contains the field qty whose value is less than or equal to 20:

db.inventory.find( { 'instock.qty': { $lte: 20 } } )
