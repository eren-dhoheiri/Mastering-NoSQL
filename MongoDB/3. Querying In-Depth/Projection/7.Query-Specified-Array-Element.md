Project Specific Array Elements in the Returned Array

For fields that contain arrays, MongoDB provides the following projection operators for manipulating arrays: $elemMatch, $slice, and $.

The following example uses the $slice projection operator to return the last element in the instock array:

db.inventory.find( { status: "A" }, { item: 1, status: 1, instock: { $slice: -1 } } )

$elemMatch, $slice, and $ are the only way to project specific elements to include in the returned array. For instance, you cannot project specific array elements using the array index; e.g. { "instock.0": 1 } projection will not project the array with the first element.
