Return All But the Excluded Fields

Instead of listing the fields to return in the matching document, you can use a projection to exclude specific fields. The following example which returns all fields except for the status and the instock fields in the matching documents:

db.inventory.find( { status: "A" }, { status: 0, instock: 0 } )

Note

With the exception of the _id field, you cannot combine inclusion and exclusion statements in projection documents.
