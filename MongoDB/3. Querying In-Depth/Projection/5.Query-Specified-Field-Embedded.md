Return Specific Fields in Embedded Documents

You can return specific fields in an embedded document. Use the dot notation to refer to the embedded field and set to 1 in the projection document.

The following example returns:

    The _id field (returned by default),
    The item field,
    The status field,
    The uom field in the size document.

The uom field remains embedded in the size document.

db.inventory.find(
   { status: "A" },
   { item: 1, status: 1, "size.uom": 1 }
)

Suppress Specific Fields in Embedded DocumentsÂ¶

You can suppress specific fields in an embedded document. Use the dot notation to refer to the embedded field in the projection document and set to 0.

The following example specifies a projection to exclude the uom field inside the size document. All other fields are returned in the matching documents:

db.inventory.find(
   { status: "A" },
   { "size.uom": 0 }
)
