Specify Multiple Conditions for Array Elements

When specifying compound conditions on array elements, you can specify the query such that either a single array element meets these condition or any combination of array elements meets the conditions.
Query an Array with Compound Filter Conditions on the Array Elements

The following example queries for documents where the dim_cm array contains elements that in some combination satisfy the query conditions; e.g., one element can satisfy the greater than 15 condition and another element can satisfy the less than 20 condition, or a single element can satisfy both:

db.inventory.find( { dim_cm: { $gt: 15, $lt: 20 } } )
