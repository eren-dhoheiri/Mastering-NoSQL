Delete All Documents that Match a Condition

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to delete. The filters use the same syntax as read operations.

To specify equality conditions, use <field>:<value> expressions in the query filter document:

{ <field1>: <value1>, ... }

A query filter document can use the query operators to specify conditions in the following form:

{ <field1>: { <operator1>: <value1> }, ... }

To delete all documents that match a deletion criteria, pass a filter parameter to the deleteMany() method.

The following example removes all documents from the inventory collection where the status field equals "A":

db.inventory.deleteMany({ status : "A" })

The method returns a document with the status of the operation. For more information and examples, see deleteMany().
