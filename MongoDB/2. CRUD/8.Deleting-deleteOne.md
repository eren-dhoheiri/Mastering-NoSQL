Delete Only One Document that Matches a Condition

To delete at most a single document that matches a specified filter (even though multiple documents may match the specified filter) use the db.collection.deleteOne() method.

The following example deletes the first document where status is "D":

db.inventory.deleteOne( { status: "D" } )
