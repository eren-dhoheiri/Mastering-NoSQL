Query an Array for an Element

To query if the array field contains at least one element with the specified value, use the filter { <field>: <value> } where <value> is the element value.

The following example queries for all documents where tags is an array that contains the string "red" as one of its elements:

db.inventory.find( { tags: "red" } )
