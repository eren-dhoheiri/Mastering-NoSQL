he following example uses the db.collection.updateMany() method on the inventory collection to update all documents where qty is less than 50:

db.inventory.updateMany(
   { "qty": { $lt: 50 } },
   {
     $set: { "size.uom": "in", status: "P" },
     $currentDate: { lastModified: true }
   }
)

The update operation:

    uses the $set operator to update the value of the size.uom field to "in" and the value of the status field to "P",
    uses the $currentDate operator to update the value of the lastModified field to the current date. If lastModified field does not exist, $currentDate will create the field. See $currentDate for details.
